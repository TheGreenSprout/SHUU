WARNING

When making devconsole commands, follow this structure:

[DevConsoleCommand("command", "description")]
public static (string[], Color?) ClearSet(parameters)
{
    
}

string[] are the output lines that will be displayed on the console,
with Color? being the color of these lines (if left null the lines will be white)


also, if you want an array of elements as a parameter, currently only "params" at the end of the parameters is supported:

[DevConsoleCommand("command", "description")]
public static (string[], Color?) ClearSet(int num1, int num2, params int[] numarray)
{
    
}
